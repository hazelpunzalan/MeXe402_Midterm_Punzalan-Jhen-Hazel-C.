# INTRODUCTION
#### Linear regression and logistic regression are two fundamental statistical methods used for predictive analysis in various fields, including business, healthcare, and social sciences.

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model and analyze the relationship between variables. Specifically, it helps us understand how changes in one or more independent variables (also known as predictors or features) affect a dependent variable (the outcome we want to predict). The core idea behind linear regression is to find a linear equation that best fits the data. This means we look for a straight line that can represent the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

Logistic Regression, on the other hand, is used when the dependent variable is categorical, particularly binary outcomes (e.g., yes/no, success/failure). Instead of predicting a continuous outcome, logistic regression estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a certain category. For instance, it can be applied to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on various characteristics. The logistic function ensures that the predicted probabilities are between 0 and 1, which is crucial for classification tasks.


# DATASET DESCRIPTION
### Linear Regression Dataset
#### The dataset offers valuable insights into how advertising spending impacts sales. It specifically looks at the effects of investments in TV, radio, and newspaper ads on sales results. By applying linear regression to the data, we can uncover the relationships between these advertising platforms and sales performance. This analysis allows us to determine which advertising channels are most effective for boosting sales, enabling us to allocate resources more efficiently. 

This analysis not only highlights which advertising mediums yield the highest return on investment but also provides a clearer understanding of consumer behavior in response to different types of advertising. By identifying effective channels, businesses can make informed decisions about where to allocate their marketing budgets, ensuring they invest in strategies that maximize sales growth. Additionally, this information can guide future advertising campaigns, helping to refine messaging and targeting for even better results. Overall, the insights gained from this dataset are crucial for developing an effective advertising strategy that aligns with sales objectives.


### Logistic Regression Dataset


# PROJECT OBJECTIVES
- we'll aim to predict the continuous sales variable based on sdvertising expenditures in TV, RADIO, and NEWSPAPER.
- we'll classify wines as either "bad quality" or "good quality" based on transformed quality scores (2 for bad, 4 for good).
